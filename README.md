    <h1 align="center">Hi, my name is xHyroM üëã</h1>
</p>

I'm a programmer. I work on a couple of open source projects, but also closed source projects. I work on projects like [Mr. Infinity](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=720321585625694239&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https://blobs.gq/imanager&prompt=consent&response_type=code), [GCommands](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/GCommands), [Muploader](https://github.com/xHyroM/Muploder), [Roles Bot](https://github.com/xHyroM/roles-bot) and many more.  
I'll be glad if you take a look at my github üòÄüëÄ.

  * [#7199263](https://github.com/xHyroM/bun/commit/7199263) Fix macOS build (#525)

* style: remove some trailing whitespace

* docs: make `identifier-cache` _before_ `jsc`

Running them the other way around results in a failed build.

* docs: `npm i` in both `test/snippets` _and_ `test/scripts`

`test/scripts` has node packages as well. If they aren&#39;t installed, then
some of the tests fail to start.

* docs: add `rust` to list of homebrew packages

One of the dependencies tries to run `cargo`, and will fail the build if
it can&#39;t. The `cargo` command is provided by the `rust` brew package.

* docs: clean up section on macOS code signing

This requirement applies to _all_ macOS builds, not just those on Apple
Silicon, and also had some slightly confusing wording.

* build: remove leading whitespace from flags

This leading whitespace was making my system treat the argument as a
file with name ` -L$(LLVM_PREFIX)/lib` (leading whitespace included),
instead of as a library path argument.

* build: try llvm@13 first, then fall back on bare llvm

The macOS instructions say to install `llvm@13`, which has a different
path than the bare `llvm` install (`brew --prefix llvm@13` != `brew
--prefix llvm`). This patch takes a slightly smarter approach:

1. If the user defined `LLVM_PREFIX` and it points to a valid path on
   disk, use that.
2. If `LLVM_PREFIX` is NOT a valid path, try setting it to the `llvm@13`
   path.
3. If it&#39;s STILL not a valid path, try the plain `llvm` path
4. If it&#39;s STILL not valid, set it to a user-friendly error.

There might be a better solution for doing this, I&#39;m not well-versed in
Makefile syntax, but it&#39;s at least slightly better than it was before.

* fix(build): update cast signature

`std.math.cast` was changed in 0e6285c8fc31ff866df96847fe34e660da38b4a9.
It used to throw if the cast would overflow, but now it returns `null`
instead.
