    <h1 align="center">Hi, my name is xHyroM üëã</h1>
</p>

I'm a programmer. I work on a couple of open source projects, but also closed source projects. I work on projects like [Mr. Infinity](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=720321585625694239&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https://blobs.gq/imanager&prompt=consent&response_type=code), [GCommands](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/GCommands), [Muploader](https://github.com/xHyroM/Muploader), [Roles Bot](https://github.com/xHyroM/roles-bot) and many more.  
I'll be glad if you take a look at my github üòÄüëÄ.

* fixed some licenses

* typo
  * [#a85413c](https://github.com/xHyroM/bun/commit/a85413c) fix scoped packages name resolution (#760)
  * [#24a5f9b](https://github.com/xHyroM/bun/commit/24a5f9b) test(wiptest): add a way to test wiptest (#699)

This adds a really basic test runner that will execute test files using
`bun wiptest` and compare the output to make sure it&#39;s correct. It could
definitely be improved, especially in the speed department, but it&#39;s at
least functional now, which is better than we had before!
  * [#e9f3768](https://github.com/xHyroM/bun/commit/e9f3768) docs: fix documentation of `atob` and `btoa` (#748)

These function are confusingly named. `btoa` converts &#34;Binary&#34; to Ascii
by encoding the input using base64. `atob` reverses that process by
base64 decoding the Ascii input into a &#34;Binary&#34; output.

The names come from the Unix utilities with the same names, which
&#34;converts a binary file to ascii for transmission over a telephone line&#34;
(https://www.unix.com/man-page/minix/1/btoa/)

See:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/btoa
- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#dom-btoa-dev

Note: the actual implementation of `btoa` and `atob` are correct, but
the docs were backwards.
