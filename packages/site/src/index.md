I'm Hyro. I mainly focus on the backend, but I also work with the frontend. I'm
always trying to maintain my projects like
[Mr. Infinity](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=720321585625694239&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https://blobs.gq/imanager&prompt=consent&response_type=code),
[GCommands](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/GCommands),
[Muploader](https://github.com/xHyroM/Muploader),
[Roles Bot](https://github.com/xHyroM/roles-bot) and many more.

I work on smaller, less demanding as well as larger and more demanding projects.
Mostly my projects are open source, but I also have closed source projects.

You can see my [projects](./projects) or my _professional_ [blog](./blog/)
